                     With a Master's in Healthcare Administration from USC and
                     software engineering certification from App Academy, I've
                     cultivated a diverse skill set that allows me to see
                     challenges from multiple angles. My journey began in
                     healthcare operations at UCLA Health, where I managed
                     strategic projects, optimized workflows, and coordinated
                     critical programs including COVID-19 screening
                     implementations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     During my time at UCLA Health, I discovered my passion for
                     leveraging technology to improve healthcare processes. This
                     led me to pursue formal training in software engineering,
                     where I've developed expertise in various technologies.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     I create solutions that combine healthcare domain knowledge
                     with technical capabilities. My approach to problem-solving
                     is rooted in understanding end-user needs, designing
                     efficient systems, and implementing technology that
                     enhances rather than complicates workflows.
